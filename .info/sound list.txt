Reminder: When finished, make a version of this list which goes over every sound required for a full, deluxe voice.

==================================================================================================================
✅BLENDS
Note: A blend is a sound like the "bl" in blend. Two letters make their own sounds but together.

	To not bloat necessary recordings we can ignore blends as they don't represent a new sound.
	Therefore, playing the letter sounds separately works well enough.

==================================================================================================================
❌GRAPHEMES (ALPHABET)
Note: It's very easy to add an 'uh' sound to the end of consonants like B becoming buh, or D to duh. So you must ensure you do not add extra sounds to the end or the resulting voice will sound bad. Also, make sure each letter is pronounced quickly. If it's too long, words will sound weird.

    ✅a ("ah" not long "ay")
    ✅b
    ✅(C is not used as it is identical to K)
    ✅d
    ✅e ("eh" not long "ee")
    ✅f
    ✅g
    ✅h
    ✅i ("ih" not long "I")
    ✅j
    ✅k
    ✅l
    ✅m
    ✅n
    ✅o ("oh" not long "oa")
    ✅p
    ✅q ("kw") [OPTIONAL: as q is a blend of the k and w sounds. But cos it's a letter, it excepts the no blend files rule.]
    ✅r
    ✅s
    ✅t
    ✅u ("uh" not long "ue")
    ✅v
    ✅w
    ✅x ("ks") [OPTIONAL: as x is a blend of the k and s sounds. But cos it's a letter, it excepts the no blend files rule.]
    ✅y ("yuh"-esque sound not a "ee")
    ✅z

==================================================================================================================
❌DIGRAPHS

	RECORDINGS NEEDED (but have fallback logic to sound each letter if digraph sound not provided)
        VOWELS
        ay
        ee
        oa

        OTHER
        sh
        ch
        th
        ng
        oo (as in too not book. as that just sounds better when used in incorrect circumstances rather than vice versa)
        er
        oi
        or / oar
	
	PURE LOGIC NEEDED (no extra recordings as these make sounds already in the alphabet)
        ph -> f
        qu -> q (where q is kw)
        ce -> s-e
        ci -> s-i
        cy -> s-ee
        any double letter -> pronounce just once (exclu oo and ee)
        ui -> oo
        ue -> oo

==================================================================================================================
❌SILENT

	PURE LOGIC
        ng -> n (FALLBACK for if no ng sound provided)

        ✅wh - w
        ✅ck -> k
        ✅kn -> n
        ✅wr -> r
        ✅gn -> n
        ✅ea -> e (theres like 4 different eas but the one that sounds the 'best' in all situations is e)
	
     in dict but logic of only at end not coded
        🟨mb (end) -> m
        🟨bt (end) -> t
        🟨dge (end) -> j
        🟨mn (end) -> n
