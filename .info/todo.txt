TO DO
- finish graphemes
    ‼️ rewrite the dict generator to be tailored to the sound needs. so go thru the graphemes, sub c for k sound, etc ‼️
    - move silences into the dictionary

- find a good module for audio speed up that works with pydub, cos pydub's one is far too low quality
- make a mode where it can speak each character LIVE so you can run text integration
