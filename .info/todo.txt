TO DO
- if a user adds a~ tilda like so on a vowel it does the long vowel sound
- find a good module for audio speed up that works with pydub, cos pydub's one is far too low quality

- overhaul live playback to use the exported audio but for text use a list of strings like before but also a list of ints of timings of when to change, theoretically this means there'll be no lag or jitter?
