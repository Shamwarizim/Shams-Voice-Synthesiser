TO DO
- ‼️ text output has capitals and lowercase ugh
- rewrite the hide_tilda setting so that it only gets rid of tildes right after vowels

- make gen_sound_dict() not a function. it does not need to be a func

- find a good module for audio speed up that works with pydub, cos pydub's one is far too low quality

- overhaul live playback to use the exported audio but for text use a list of strings like before but also a list of ints of timings of when to change, theoretically this means there'll be no lag or jitter?

- bug: when you dont have long vowel sounds, the tilde li~ke so~ is read out
